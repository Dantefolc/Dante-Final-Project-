STA-215-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. I took data from members from the house of reps for the US and looked at quantitative and qualitative variables.  Some topics were age,wealth, voting record, education ect.   
Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "Final_Project_Script.R" file, which contains the code for my project. 
Data
The data collected for this project was data collected on members of the house of reps.  There was a wide range of data and variables.  My group and I split the people up each doing 50 ish and doing all the categories.  It took hours of research and a lot of time but overall it was cool seeing some representatives' ideas and what they support.  We also had a lot of variables so it took longer.
Operationalization
To operationalize the data I would go to the house of reps website to find mist the data.  It overall was not hard to find most of the data considering it is public knowledge and data.  Finding wealth was hard since some people were private or did not have much wealth.  Some members' religion was hard to find since they did not specify what they were. Party and age were the easiest two parts of the data to find since most have it listed on their websites.
